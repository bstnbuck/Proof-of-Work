# Proof-of-Work
Simple Proof-of-Work implementation in Python

Hey there!
In this mini project I created a proof-of-work implementation in Python.

---
There are three functions: `pow(text)`, `pown()` and `proof(hasht, text)`.

Function `pow(text)` do proof-of-work with given "text" and with SHA256 hash.

In function `pown()` you can choose between hash function SHA512, SHA256 and MD5. By the way MD5 is not recommend for secure password hashing!

In function `proof()` you can proof the functionality of the other functions. Pass the hash and the text here.
